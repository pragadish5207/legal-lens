      questions: [
        { q: "What is the Risk-O-Meter, and how is it calculated?", a: "The Risk-O-Meter evaluates contracts on a 0-10 scale based on 'Supreme Court Level' strictness. It scans for missing statutory clauses, uncertain terms, and violations of the Indian Contract Act." },
        { q: "Does Legal-Lens Pro store my documents?", a: "No. Privacy is built-in. We use real-time processing via Gemini 1.5 Flash API. No data is saved to our servers once your session ends." },
        { q: "How do I find local legal aid?", a: "Our Pan-India DLSA integration covers 750+ districts. Select your region to find contact details for authorized legal services." },
        { q: "Can I scan contracts in regional languages?", a: "Yes. We support 50+ languages including Gujarati, Hindi, and Tamil, ensuring legal literacy reaches everyone." },
        { q: "Why was this tool created?", a: "Built by Pragadishwar, this project bridges the gap between commerce expertise and AI to democratize access to justice in India." },
        { q: "Is this part of a suite?", a: "Yes, it belongs to the 'Lens Intelligence Suite,' a coordinated ecosystem of AI tools for Study, Law, and Data." },
        { q: "What makes the AI analysis accurate?", a: "We leverage Gemini 1.5 Flash's 1-million token context window to cross-reference your text against Indian statutes instantly." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "II. Indian Contract Act (Statutory Logic)",
      questions: [
        { q: "What defines a valid contract (Section 10)?", a: "Under Section 10, an agreement must have free consent, competent parties, lawful consideration, and a lawful object. Missing any makes it void." },
        { q: "What is 'Void for Uncertainty' (Section 29)?", a: "Section 29 states agreements with vague meanings are void. Terms like 'pay soon' without dates are high-risk flags." },
        { q: "Is consideration mandatory (Section 25)?", a: "Yes. Except for specific exceptions like registered gifts between relatives, a contract without consideration is void." },
        { q: "Are verbal contracts valid in India?", a: "Generally, yes, but they are incredibly difficult to prove. Written contracts are always recommended for legal safety." },
        { q: "What is 'Undue Influence' in a contract?", a: "It occurs when one party dominates the will of another. If detected, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the victim." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "III. Stamp Duty & Admissibility",
      questions: [
        { q: "Is ₹100 stamp paper enough for everything?", a: "No. Different deeds require different duty rates. Under-stamping makes a document inadmissible in court under the Stamp Act." },
        { q: "What is the Indian Stamp Act, 1899?", a: "It is a fiscal law that requires specific taxes (stamps) to be paid on legal documents to make them enforceable." },
        { q: "Can I pay stamp duty after signing?", a: "Yes, but you may face heavy penalties (up to 10 times the original duty) to make the document admissible later." },
        { q: "What is Non-Judicial stamp paper?", a: "It is used for executing legal documents like power of attorney, sale deeds, and rental agreements." },
        { q: "Does Gujarat have specific stamp duty rules?", a: "Yes, stamp duty is a state subject. Gujarat has specific rates under the Gujarat Stamp Act, 1958." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "IV. Scam Shield & Digital Laws",
      questions: [
        { q: "Is holding original certificates legal?", a: "No. Companies holding original educational certificates as a 'security' is a major predatory practice and often a scam." },
        { q: "Are WhatsApp agreements legally binding?", a: "They can be admitted as electronic records under the IT Act, 2000, provided they meet the criteria for a clear agreement." },
        { q: "What is the IT Act, 2000?", a: "It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce, validating e-signatures and digital records." },
        { q: "Is an Aadhaar eSign valid?", a: "Yes. Under Section 5 of the IT Act, Aadhaar-based eSignatures carry the same weight as physical ink signatures." },
        { q: "Why is a 'security deposit' for a job a red flag?", a: "Legitimate employers never ask for money to provide a job. This is a classic scam pattern detected by our Scam Shield." },
        { q: "What should I do if the AI score is 10/10?", a: "Do not sign. A 10/10 score means the document has fatal legal flaws or scam patterns. Consult a lawyer immediately." },
        { q: "How do I report a legal scam?", a: "You can use our DLSA integration to find your local district legal authority and file a formal complaint." },
        { q: "Is this tool a substitute for a lawyer?", a: "No. This is an AI risk-detection assistant. For final legal execution, always consult a qualified advocate." }
