      category: "I. Legal-Lens Pro: Features & Usage",
      questions: [
        { q: "What is the Risk-O-Meter, and how is it calculated?", a: "The Risk-O-Meter evaluates contracts on a 0-10 scale. It uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to scan for missing statutory clauses, uncertain terms, and violations of the Indian Contract Act. A higher score indicates higher predatory risk." },
        { q: "Does Legal-Lens Pro store my documents?", a: "No. Privacy is our priority. We use real-time processing via the API. No data, PDF, or image is saved to our servers once your session ends." },
        { q: "How do I find local legal aid?", a: "Our Pan-India DLSA integration covers 750+ districts. Use the 'Find Legal Help' tool to locate authorized legal services in your specific State and District." },
        { q: "Can I scan contracts in regional languages?", a: "Yes. We support 50+ languages including Gujarati, Hindi, Tamil, and Marathi, ensuring legal literacy reaches every corner of India." },
        { q: "Why was this tool created?", a: "Built by Pragadishwar, this project bridges the gap between B.Com expertise and AI to democratize access to justice and simplify complex legal jargon." },
        { q: "Is this part of a suite?", a: "Yes, it belongs to the 'Lens Intelligence Suite,' a coordinated ecosystem of AI tools including Study-Lens Pro and Zero-to-SEO." },
        { q: "What makes the AI analysis accurate?", a: "We leverage a 1-million token context window to cross-reference your text against Indian statutes and Supreme Court precedents instantly." },
        { q: "Why is the desktop view recommended?", a: "The desktop layout features a 3-column dashboard with live Legal Tips and Case Studies that provide extra context while you analyze your document." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "II. Indian Contract Act (Statutory Logic)",
      questions: [
        { q: "What defines a valid contract (Section 10)?", a: "Under Section 10, an agreement must have free consent, competent parties, lawful consideration, and a lawful object. If any are missing, the AI flags the contract as void." },
        { q: "What is 'Void for Uncertainty' (Section 29)?", a: "Section 29 states that agreements with vague meanings are void. Terms like 'pay soon' or 'reasonable time' without dates are high-risk red flags." },
        { q: "Is consideration mandatory (Section 25)?", a: "Yes. Except for specific exceptions like registered gifts between relatives, a contract without consideration (payment/value) is void in India." },
        { q: "Are verbal contracts valid in India?", a: "Yes, they are legally valid but incredibly difficult to prove in court. Our AI helps you convert verbal promises into written, structured analysis for safety." },
        { q: "What is 'Undue Influence' (Section 16)?", a: "It occurs when one party dominates the will of another. If the AI detects predatory language or lopsided power dynamics, it flags potential Section 16 violations." },
        { q: "What is an 'Unlawful Object' (Section 23)?", a: "If a contract involves anything illegal, fraudulent, or injurious to others, it is void. The AI scans for clauses that violate public policy." },
        { q: "Can a minor sign a contract?", a: "In India, an agreement with a minor (under 18) is void-ab-initio (void from the beginning). The AI flags any party-competency issues it detects." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "III. Stamp Duty & Admissibility",
      questions: [
        { q: "Is ₹100 stamp paper enough for every agreement?", a: "No. Stamp duty is a fiscal tax that varies by document type and State law. Under-stamping makes a document 'inadmissible as evidence' in court under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899." },
        { q: "What is the Gujarat Stamp Act, 1958?", a: "Since stamp duty is a state subject, Gujarat follows its own specific rates. For example, rental agreements and partnership deeds have specific duty structures unique to Gujarat." },
        { q: "Can I pay stamp duty after signing a document?", a: "Yes, but it is risky. You may have to pay a penalty (up to 10 times the original duty) to a Collector to make the document legally valid later." },
        { q: "What is the difference between Judicial and Non-Judicial stamp paper?", a: "Judicial stamps are for court fees. Non-Judicial stamps (like the ones our AI checks for) are used for contracts, deeds, and powers of attorney." },
        { q: "Does an e-Stamp carry the same weight as physical paper?", a: "Yes. E-stamping is a secure way of paying non-judicial stamp duty and is fully recognized as valid evidence under Indian law." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "IV. Scam Shield & Digital Laws",
      questions: [
        { q: "Are WhatsApp and Email agreements legally binding?", a: "Yes, under the IT Act, 2000, electronic records and communications are admissible as evidence provided they meet the criteria of a clear offer and acceptance." },
        { q: "What is the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023?", a: "This is India's latest privacy law. Legal-Lens Pro respects these principles by ensuring your uploaded documents are processed in real-time and never stored permanently." },
        { q: "Is an Aadhaar eSign as valid as a physical signature?", a: "Yes. Under Section 5 of the IT Act, recognized digital signatures (like Aadhaar-based eSigns) carry the same legal weight as a wet-ink signature." },
        { q: "Why is a 'security deposit' for a job a major red flag?", a: "Legitimate employers never ask for money to provide a job. Our 'Scam Shield' logic flags this as a predatory pattern commonly used in employment fraud." },
        { q: "Is it legal for a company to hold my original certificates?", a: "No. The Supreme Court and UGC have ruled that holding original educational certificates as 'security' is illegal. The AI will flag any such 'Bond' clauses." },
        { q: "What is a 'Non-Compete' clause in India?", a: "Under Section 27 of the Contract Act, any agreement that restrains someone from practicing a profession is generally void. The AI helps identify if your employer's non-compete is too restrictive." },
        { q: "How do I report a legal scam detected by the AI?", a: "Use the DLSA integration on our dashboard to find your local authority. You can provide the AI's Risk Report as supporting context when filing a complaint." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "V. Liability & Professional Safeguards",
      questions: [
        { q: "Is the AI's Risk Score a final legal judgment?", a: "No. It is a data-driven diagnostic based on Gemini 1.5's analysis of your text. It does not account for specific situational nuances that only a qualified human lawyer can evaluate." },
        { q: "Can Legal-Lens Pro be held liable for contract disputes?", a: "No. As stated in our User Agreement, this is an educational tool. Users are solely responsible for their legal decisions. The AI provides a 'first look,' not a 'final word.'" },
        { q: "Why do I still need a lawyer if I have AI?", a: "AI scans for patterns and statutory red flags (like Section 29 or Section 25), but a lawyer provides strategy, courtroom representation, and professional empathy. AI is your first line of defense; an advocate is your ultimate shield." },
        { q: "Does this tool create an attorney-client relationship?", a: "No. Use of this application does not constitute legal representation or an attorney-client relationship. It is an AI-assisted research and literacy platform." }
      ]
    },
    {
      category: "VI. Advanced Legal Concepts & SEO Knowledge",
      questions: [
        { q: "What is 'Force Majeure' (Section 56)?", a: "Known as the 'Doctrine of Frustration,' it deals with contracts that become impossible to perform due to unforeseen events (like a pandemic or natural disaster). The AI scans for how these clauses are worded." },
        { q: "What is the difference between 'Agreement' and 'Contract'?", a: "Under Section 2(h), an agreement enforceable by law is a contract. Our AI checks if your 'Agreement' meets the legal criteria to be an 'Enforceable Contract.'" },
        { q: "What are 'Liquidated Damages'?", a: "This is a pre-fixed amount to be paid in case of a breach. The AI scans for whether these amounts are reasonable or if they act as an illegal 'Penalty' under Indian law." },
        { q: "Why is 'Jurisdiction' important in a contract?", a: "It specifies which court has the power to hear a dispute. 'Subject to Ahmedabad Jurisdiction' means legal battles must happen in Ahmedabad courts, even if the parties live elsewhere." },
        { q: "What is 'Novation' of a contract (Section 62)?", a: "It is the act of replacing an old contract with a new one. The AI flags if a new agreement is trying to override your existing legal rights without clear consent." }
